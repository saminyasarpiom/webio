        <h2 class="section-title">MY YouTube JOURNEY</h2>

        <p class="section-info">The first ever skill I acquired in my life is video editing. In the year 2018, when I was a student of class Std. VI, I got interest in how videos are edited, and especially how songs are added in the background of a video. With this, I downloaded an app called- 'Background Music Editor' or something like this, which was mainly an app to add background musics to background and trim videos. Then I recorded videos - on making a paper 'Ninja Star' and 'Paper Photo Frame' in an afternoon. To be exact, it was March 14, 2018. Although I uploaded the videos on two different days (14/03/2018 & 15/03/2018). I then added a simple nursery song (I know it's wiered but I am wiered myself) and thought that - 'Wow, I have edited a video!'. Then I made an YouTube channel named- 'Craft Knowledge' and uploaded my videos on there. From then on, I got introduced with many advanced video editors on both mobile and laptop, and acquired more editing skills and yes, now I have 3 YouTube channels! More info about the channels is given below.</p>
